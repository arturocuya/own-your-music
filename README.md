# Own your music

This codebase runs a local web app to scan your Spotify Liked Songs and find them on Bandcamp. Powered by Go + HTMX + Templ.

> Note: Carefully read Bandcamp's Acceptable Use and Moderation policy before using this program. Just saying :p

To run in, clone the repository and run `go run *.go` inside the root directory.

### To-do:

- [x] Implement Amazon Music provider
- [ ] Add proxy for Amazon (so that you don't get flagged as a crawler bot)
- [ ] Windows binary
- [ ] OSX binary
